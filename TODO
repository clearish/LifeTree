The image on Eryngium_Leavenworthii is missing because of Eryngium_leavenworthii?

Node naming problem on Abbottina_(Jordan__amp_amp_x__Fowler).svg

Propogate images up the tree!
This will fix the non-reachability of Amoebazoa, Tyrannosauroidea, Carnosauria, etc.
(Or, more ambitiously, overwrite ALL non-leaf images with the most important contained image.)

Deal with mistaken spaces in things like {{sp|D|entex| fourmanoiri}}

  Try grep "{{sp[^×}]* "

Possible to set node backgrounds to white, not transparent?
[node fillcolor=white] didn't seem to work.
But this might have to do with display order...

Deeper edges should appear over higher ones (like before!)

Make the root note white on black so it stands out.

Tooltips for leaves aren't working…  shouldn't be common names.
In calcBests.pl AND calcBests.Batch.pl try changing:
	<<table title=\"$label\"    -->  $tooltip	(on all three lines?)

Always scale up to fit a box?  In makegraph.pl, add ! in size="X,Y!"

Increase image sizes in small graphs.

Propagate extinctness down the tree?
